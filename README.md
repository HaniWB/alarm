# Countdown Timer with Breaks

This is a simple countdown timer application that includes a work-break cycle, inspired by the Pomodoro Technique. The timer starts with 25 minutes of work, followed by a 5-minute break, and after four cycles, a longer 15-minute break. The app plays an alert sound when it's time for a break or when the session ends.

## Features

- **Start, Stop, and Skip Buttons:**
  - **Start:** Starts the countdown from 25 minutes.
  - **Stop:** Stops the countdown at any point.
  - **Skip:** Skips the current cycle (starts a break early or finishes the session early).
  
- **Work/Break Cycle:**
  - **25 minutes of work:** The timer begins with a 25-minute work session.
  - **5-minute break:** After the work session ends, a 5-minute break is prompted.
  - **15-minute break after 4 cycles:** After completing four cycles of work and short breaks, a 15-minute "real" break is prompted.

- **Alert Sound:** Plays a sound whenever the cycle changes (work to break or vice versa).

## How to Use

1. **Open the Application:**
   - Open `index.html` in your browser.

   - **Stop**: Click the "Stop" button to halt the timer at any point.
   - **Skip**: Click the "Skip" button to instantly trigger the break.

3. **Timer Behavior:**
   - The timer starts at 25 minutes and counts down every second.
   - After the work session is finished (25 minutes), it prompts a 5-minute break.
   - After 4 work-break cycles, a 15-minute break is prompted instead.
   
4. **Alerts and Sounds:**
   - Each break will trigger an alert and play a sound.
   - When the cycle is over (back to work), it will also play a sound and notify you.
